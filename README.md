#Hello everyone, I'm Emmanuel Nyandu Kagarabi.

I have a background in `Mathematics` and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in `Artificial Intelligence for Science` at `AIMS South Africa` - `Stellenbosch University`. My studies are fully funded by Google DeepMind. You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/emmanuelnyandukagarabi/Curriculum-Vitae).

My interests lie in the fundamental mathematics of Machine Learning. I am deeply curious about understanding concepts in depth. Additionally, I am interested in Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning, with a specific focus on `Generative Artificial Intelligence`. I am actively involved in innovating and developing robust large-scale models by leveraging `Diffusion Models`, `VAEs`, and `GANs`.

I am open to engaging in discussions about the role of Mathematics in AI. If you would like to discuss or collaborate, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-nyandu-kagarabi-5410a4304/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/emmanuel.kagarabi), or via [Gmail](emmanuelnk@aims.ac.za). Thank you!
