# Hello everyone, I'm Emmanuel Nyandu Kagarabi

I have a  background in Mathematics and am currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence for Science, fully funded by Google DeepMind, at AIMS South Africa -- Stellenbosch University.

My interests span the fundamental mathematics of Machine Learning, where I am deeply curious about understanding concepts in depth. I am also keen on Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning, culminating in my passion for Generative Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly focused on using Diffusion Models, VAEs, and GANs to contribute to innovative solutions and the development of large models.

I am open to engaging in discussions about the role of Mathematics in AI. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-nyandu-kagarabi-5410a4304/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/emmanuel.kagarabi), or via [Gmail](emmanuelnk@aims.ac.za) if youâ€™d like to discuss or collaborate. Thank you!
