# Hello everyone, I'm Emmanuel Nyandu Kagarabi

I have a background in Mathematics and am currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence for Science, fully funded by Google DeepMind, at AIMS South Africa, affiliated at Stellenbosch University. My interests span the fundamental mathematics of machine learning, progressing through computer vision, Reinforcement Learning and deep learning, and culminating in generative AI. I am particularly focused on using Diffusion Models, VAEs, and GANs to solve real-life problems and create innovative solutions.
